      <description>I have recently been interested in switching from the Keras and TensorFlow deep learning frameworks to the PyTorch framework. Rather than making a thorough and passionate internet argument on why I believe that PyTorch is the better choice, I think a comparison between implementations of a simple neural network (MNIST) says enough about the decision to switch.
For the sake of comparison, I initially wanted to implement MNIST in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.</description>

      <description>iidblog is a play on words. For the mathematics and statistics communities, iid is an initialism which stands for independent and identically distributed and describes a desirable property of random variables for machine learning. For this blog, iid describes the sentiment of my take at yet another professional blog on machine learning.
I hope you enjoy.</description>
