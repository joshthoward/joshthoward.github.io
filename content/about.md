*iidblog* is a play on words. For the mathematics and statistics communities,
*iid* is an initialism which stands for independent and identically distributed
and describes a desirable property of random variables for machine learning.
For this blog, *iid* describes the sentiment of my take at yet another
professional blog on machine learning.

I hope you enjoy.
